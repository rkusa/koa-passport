[Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) middleware for Koa

## Example

```js
// body parser
var bodyParser = require('koa-bodyparser')
app.use(bodyParser())

// Sessions
var session = require('koa-session')
app.keys = ['secret']
app.use(session())

var passport = require('koa-passport')
app.use(passport.initialize())
app.use(passport.session())
```


## Function mapping

You can use passport functions on the ctx object directly. The user is available on the request object and not req, because in Koa req is the raw node request object.

```js
app.use(function *() {
  var user = this.request.user

  // isAuth
  if(this.isAuthenticated())

  // login
  this.login(/*...*/)
  this.logIn(/*...*/)

  // same thing for logout, isUnauthenticated
})

```
